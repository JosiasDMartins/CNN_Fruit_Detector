# A CNN Fruit Detector
 This is a Fruit Detector (like an object detector) based on the CNN model.

 This project was conceived as a study purpose project, to explore object detection methodologies like the "pyramid and sliding" method and to explore CNN hyperparametrization and ETL to merge different datasets 

## Project details

This project is split into two main files:
- Fruit_model: Jupyter notebook for the model training
- Object_Detection: Python Software to identify fruits on a video

All the files needed to run the "Object Detection" Python Software are provided in the "aditional_files" folder.
